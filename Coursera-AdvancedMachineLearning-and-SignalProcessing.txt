  # Watching the lectures on Wavelet Tranforms
  - Highlights the limitations of Fourier Transforms in the case of non-stationary signals
  - Demos this pipeline:
    -- Signal --> CWT --> Coefficients --> PCA --> SVM/Classifier
  # Thoughts:
  - How could I use a similar pipeline on the datasets I have?
